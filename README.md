# guidemaker-ember-template


This addon provides the general layout and some styles that are used for
[guides.emberjs.com](https://guides.emberjs.com/release).

Its responsibilities include:
- CSS for the sidebar
- HTML markup specifics (i.e. the classes that go on various divs in the text of the
guide itself)

## Related apps

[guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) is what
assembles guides content into queryable records.

[guides-source](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source)
