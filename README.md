# guidemaker-ember-template

This addon provides the general layout and some styles that are used for documentation websites such as [guides.emberjs.com](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/), and [cli.emberjs.com](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/).

Its responsibilities include
- CSS for the sidebar
- HTML markup specifics (i.e. the classes that go on various divs in the text of the guide itself)

## Related apps

Most aspects of the Guides are styled via [ember-styleguide](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide), not this repository.

[guidemaker](https://github.com/empress/guidemaker) is what assembles guides content into queryable records.

[guides-source](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source) has the learning content itself.
